# Storyteller

## Overview

Welcome to the Storyteller repository.
Storyteller is a web-based application to assist the generation of user stories.
It works with Firebase and AngularJS to enable realtime collaboration and user story analysis.
Many users can work on a storyboard simulateously and see each others changes instantly.
While changes are being made, the server analyzes changes to find overly technical stories or duplicate information.

Other features of Storyteller include three-dimensional categorization of stories by acceptance and due date, perspective by user, and story groups.
